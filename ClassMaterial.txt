1. First Lecture:-
	-Basic Revesion
	-Contracts

2. Second Lecture:-
	- ERC-20 Defination
	- ERC -20  Explaination to the code.
	- ERC Token : Code Explaination.
	
3. Third Lecture 
	- Mint Function
	- Revision of Open Zapllien

4. Fourth Lecture
	- Quiz :- 
		1. when user send token it should send some percentage of amount send into the beneficary account.  
		2. Only owner can change the percentage amount.
5. Fifth Lecture:- 

1.   -on each transfer, 5% of tokens should burn and 10% should mint.
	-when tokens burn it should mint more tokens and add into 	total supply.
	
	mint - increase in total supply
	burn - decrease in total supply

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender(); //Owner
        uint burnValue = (value*5)/100; //burnValue
        value-=burnValue;              //detecting burn value from actual value.
       
        uint mintValue=(value*10)/100;  // increasing mint Value from 10% 
        _burn(owner, burnValue); 
        
        _mint(owner, mintValue);
        
        _transfer(owner, to, value);
        return true;
    }


2. Staking smart Contract
	- when user stake the money on withdraw it should increase the amount to 5%.
	functions:-
		1. Stake Money



To Study:-
- First Learn the Openzapplien Token Boiler Plate code.
- Then start using extension into it.
